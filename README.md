# Media Accessibility Project
The goal of this project is to research various methods of modern accessibility practices when it comes to displaying video, audio, and also optimal HTML tagging for screenreaders.
Another goal is to display a high contrast and easy to navigate interface for those with visual impairment.
The practices are carried out on two video files, and one audio.

### Roadmap and Notes
